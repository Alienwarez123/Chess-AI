This project focuses on Computer Science concepts such as data structures and algorithms. We are utilizing a tree to generate the possible Chess boards 4 levels deep and Breadth First Search, Minimax, and Alpha-Beta Pruning to find the best move based on a variety of yet-to-be determined heuristics.
