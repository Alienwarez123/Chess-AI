# Chess AI

This project focuses on computer science concepts such as data structures and algorithms. Chessnut is the chess engine we are using for all the moves and chess logic. We are utilizing a tree to generate the possible chessboards 3 levels deep and depth first search, minimax, and alpha-beta pruning to find the best move based on the following heuristics:

* material (total piece count for each player)
* number of possible legal moves with emphasis on center squares
* check/checkmate status
* pawn structure

Currently trying to implement multiprocessing as our recursive function uses a lot of computing power so calculating heuristics on board states more than 4 levels deep takes a lot of time. With a depth of 3 leves, our AI makes pretty good moves but also makes a lot of ill-advised ones as well. The AI's chess intelligence is estimated to be at a level 3 out of 9.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Stay what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
